‘Best Practices for Machine Learning engineering’

-Don’t be afraid to launch a product without ML.

-Make metrics design and implementation a priority.

-Choose machine learning over a complex heuristic.

-Keep the first model simple and get the infrastructure right.

-Test the infrastructure independently from the machine learning.

-Be careful about dropped data when copying pipelines.

-Turn heuristics into features, or handle them externally.

-Know the freshness requirements of your system.

-Detect problems before exporting models.

-Watch for silent failures.

-Give feature sets owners and documentation.

-Don’t overthink which objective you choose to directly optimize.

-Choose a simple, observable and attributable metric for your first objective.

-Starting with an interpretable model makes debugging easier.

-Separate Spam Filtering and Quality Ranking in a Policy Layer.

-Plan to launch and iterate.

-Start with directly observed and reported features.

-Use very specific features when you can.
